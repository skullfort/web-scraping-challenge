# web-scraping-challenge

03/09/2023

This challenge is comprised of data analysis and visualization done on data scraped from webpages using Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. The analysis and results are documented in `part_1_mars_news.ipynb` and `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`. The weather data output as a CSV file can be found in the `output` folder. Alternate solutions to certain questions are provided to gain additional insight into the Mars Weather dataset.
